This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The build process fails with an error message indicating that the Android build tools are not correctly configured or are missing. This often happens due to issues with the Android SDK, NDK, or build-tools versions, or inconsistencies in environment variables.  The exact error message can vary but often includes terms like 'build failed' or references to specific build tools or files.
