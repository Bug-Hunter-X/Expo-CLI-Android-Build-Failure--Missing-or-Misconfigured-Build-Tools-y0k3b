The solution to the Expo CLI Android build failure involves a multi-step process to verify and correct the Android development environment.  This is crucial as Expo relies on these tools to compile the app. 

1. **Verify Android SDK Installation:** Ensure the Android SDK is installed correctly. If not, download and install it from the official Android developer website.
2. **Check Environment Variables:** Verify that the environment variables `ANDROID_HOME` (pointing to the root of your Android SDK installation) and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` are set correctly and that `%ANDROID_HOME%\tools` and `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools` (or their Linux/macOS equivalents) are included in your system's `PATH` environment variable.  Restart your terminal after making these changes.
3. **Install Necessary Build Tools:** Open Android Studio's SDK Manager and make sure the necessary build tools are installed (Command line tools, Android SDK Build-Tools versions compatible with your project).  You may need to update them to the latest versions or install specific versions required by your project dependencies.
4. **Verify NDK Installation:** Ensure the Android NDK is installed if your project requires native modules. You can find the NDK in the SDK manager, install or update it there. Confirm the correct NDK path is set correctly.  
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Clean the project's build cache using `expo prebuild --clean` followed by running `expo prebuild` and then `expo build:android`. If the issue persists after these steps, check the detailed error messages carefully.  They often provide clues to the specific tool or file causing the problem. You might need to consult the Expo documentation and other online resources for more specific guidance on your particular error message.
